"""Utilities for Declarative Typed Argument Parsing.

This package contains helper utility functions for the typed argument parsing
process, including formatting argument names and descriptions, formatting
errors, recursively parsing `argparse.Namespace` objects to `dict`s,
constructing named partial type casting functions and determining the types of
`pydantic` fields.

The functionality outlined above is so common throughout the typed argument
parsing process that the functions have been refactored out into this module as
utility functions.

The public interface exposed by this package is the various described utility
modules each containing helper functions.
